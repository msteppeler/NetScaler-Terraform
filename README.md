# NetScaler-Terraform

Using Terraform is an easy way to establish a stable desired state configuration of your Netscaler environment.
Here I've published some sample scripts you can use for your environment.
 
Please be aware that this content should only be used in Demo environments. If you implement this in a production environment, test it on a seperate NetScaler first. It's your own risk!
